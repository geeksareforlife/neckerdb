A celebration of the Scout and Guide neckers - and the stories they tell.

## What is NeckerDB?

NeckerDB is a digital collection of neckerchiefs worn by Scout and Guide groups, districts, counties, regions, and events - past and present.

Each necker tells a story. From colours chosen decades ago to custom designs for international trips or jamborees, these humble triangles of fabric connect generations of young people to something bigger than themselves.

Our mission is to capture, catalogue and celebrate these designs in one central place - for leaders, young people, historians, collectors, and the curious.
