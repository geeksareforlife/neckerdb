Every necker tells a story — and we’d love to add yours to the archive!
Submitting your group’s necker is quick, easy, and helps preserve the history and identity of Scouting and Guiding for everyone.

## What You’ll Need
Before you start, make sure you have:

- {{< fa camera >}} A photo of the necker (flat or worn)
- {{< fa pen-to-square>}} Details about your group (name, location, and any history you can share)
- {{< fa palette >}} Colours and pattern description (to help others identify it)

## How to Submit
1. Create a free GitHub account
    - [Sign up for GitHub here](https://github.com/signup) — it only takes a couple of minutes.
    - GitHub is the platform we use to store and organise submissions.

2. Fill out the submission form
    - Once you’re signed in to GitHub, head to our form: [Submit a Necker](https://github.com/geeksareforlife/neckerdb/issues/new?template=submit-necker.yml)

3. Upload your necker photo
    - You can attach your image directly to the submission form.

    - Click “Submit new issue” and your necker will be added to the review queue.
    - Once approved, it will appear on the archive.
