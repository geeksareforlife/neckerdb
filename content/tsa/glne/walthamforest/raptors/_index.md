Black and Yellow were chosen as a nod to our partnership with the [23rd Chingford]({{% ref "/tsa/glne/walthamforest/23rdchingford/" %}}), reflecting our connection and shared support.

Purple sets the Raptors apart — adding a unique touch that represents progression from the 23rd Chingford Scouts to the next stage: Raptors Explorers.
