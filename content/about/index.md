A celebration of the Scout and Guide neckers - and the stories they tell.

## What is NeckerDB?

NeckerDB is a digital collection of neckerchiefs worn by Scout and Guide groups, districts, counties, regions, and events - past and present.

Each necker tells a story. From colours chosen decades ago to custom designs for international trips or jamborees, these humble triangles of fabric connect generations of young people to something bigger than themselves.

Our mission is to capture, catalogue and celebrate these designs in one central place - for leaders, young people, historians, collectors, and the curious.

## How many?

At the latest count we have catalogued **{{< neckercount >}}** individual neckers, but we still need your help!

We have [*{{< neckercount unknown >}} neckers*]({{% ref "/unknown" %}}) that we are pretty certain exist, but we don't have their details. Check out the list and let us know if you know any of them.

Also, if we don't have your necker you can [submit it]({{% ref "/submit" %}}) and we'll add it.
